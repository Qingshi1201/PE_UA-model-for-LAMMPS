# Polymer generator features
The modules create amorphous polymers, simple end-to-end polymer network and valcanized network in united atom format for LAMMPS simulation. 
The polymer builders accepts parameters including number and size of polymers and crosslinking agents, functionality of crosslinking agents and extent of reaction.
The chain replication could replicate any polymer chains given the single-chain model for atomistic molecular dynamics simulation.
